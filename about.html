        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            This website was developed as part of the NASA App Challenge to address real-world problems with a focus on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our goal is to provide a platform that educates and empowers students, particularly high school students, to understand and engage with these goals in meaningful ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            By introducing high school students to SDGs early on, we believe they can develop a strong foundation for thinking critically about global challenges such as poverty, climate action, and equality. This platform offers educational resources, interactive lessons, and real-world applications to help students grasp how their actions today can create a better tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our website is designed with a mission to raise awareness about sustainable practices and inspire the next generation to take action. We envision a future where students are not just taught about these global challenges but are encouraged to come up with creative solutions. Through Virtual-Based learning and collaboration, we hope to see students turning knowledge into action and making a difference in their communities.
        </p>
        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>
            Our mission is to foster a learning environment that promotes sustainability awareness, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills among students. We aim to empower them to actively engage with the Sustainable Development Goals and become agents of change in their own communities.
        </p>
        <h3>Vision</h3>
        <p>
            We envision a world where every student is equipped with the knowledge and tools to tackle the pressing challenges of our time. By understanding and implementing Sustainable Development Goals, we believe students can contribute to building a more equitable, sustainable, and prosperous future for all.
